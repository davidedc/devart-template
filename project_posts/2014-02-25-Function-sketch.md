A sketch of functionality 'blocks' and information links
--------------------------------------------------------
Within each patch of this sketch there are bits of code that already work
or have been tested in outline, there are also large gaps that need filling
in. In descending order of size:

  - continually add to the 'wow' factor of the animation. New shader features,
    reactivity, geometries, etc.
  - javascript tablet interface for tablets. Very simple but needs to look
    the part.
  - integrate html server into animation so browsers on the network can
    control the action
  - synchronisation of slave pis. This will probably be delayed to 2nd phase
  - integrate mgp321 subprocess into the animation so music also feeds in
    some control.
