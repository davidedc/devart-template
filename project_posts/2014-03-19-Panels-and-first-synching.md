Panels and first synching
-----------------------

The main panels are now in place. See overlay with original vs. achieved layout.

Also the five foreground shader radio-buttons are now fully operative. They even synch back
with the server - although we are working to reduce the rubber-banding of the UI as the clients
synch back and forth with the server.
