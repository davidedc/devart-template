Multiple Raspberry Pis show the same scene from different camera angles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty much all the elements are in place now. The animation integrates
changes and effects with music being played by the master Pi and multiple
client Raspberry Pis on the network will synch with the master Pi

It's hard to put a link to the video so you can see it, so I have tried
putting it in the project_summary (see above).
