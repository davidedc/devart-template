Will the real UI please standup
----------------------

We are there in the end. One day from real-life demo and we have the finished UI.

also here is a comparison between the original mock and the final version:

Note that the UI text will look all over the place in Desktop mode. For some reason there are some key differences in text metrics between Desktop and Android mode. We could work around that but for the demo this will suffice.
