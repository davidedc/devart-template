UI Drafts V5
------------

We are now starting to sketch drafts where the palette and the layout are relevant and convey the right "tone". For the time being we chose to sketch for a 7-inch device with a particular resolution (768 x 1024). We'll brainstorm on how to fit more screen sizes and proportions, but for the immediate this will do.

Some thumbnails of some variants (including a false start where content was overflowing big times):

A couple of drafts in larger resolution:

...and a couple of "in-device" shots:
