A sketch and preliminary projection tests
-----------------------------------------------
A draft sketch of what the basic installation would look like, and a couple of projection tests on the coffeetable. In which we
* remember that shutter speed and projector colour wheel sometimes are friends and sometimes aren't (with interesting results)
* start thinking about simple ways to cut out "excessive" projection overflowing the table surface.
