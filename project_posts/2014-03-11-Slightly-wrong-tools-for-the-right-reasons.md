The slightly wrong tools... for the right reasons
-------------------------------
This is something I've seen often in art/hack projects: sometimes the frameworks/tools that end-up being used are not the latest and greatest "dedicated" tools in the shop. They are often the slightly wrong tool. Manual graphic operations to draw UIs are a classic. Light web frameworks (both client and server) and file-based databases are other examples. It's very interesting - for these kinds of projects there are very subtle requirements of flexibility, low-level controllability, easiness of configuration, transparency of inner working and of the performance model. What the artist/tinkerer can usually control is the scope and the exact design of the project. What she cannot afford to hit is an obscure performance model hurdle buried deep in a framework she didn't write. The result is that often "light" non-specialised frameworks and tools are preferred.
