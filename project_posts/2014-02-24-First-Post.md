Playful geometries
------------------

We (Patrick Gaunt aka @paddywwoof and Davide Della Casa aka @davidedc) are starting the "Playful geometries" project - a nifty coloured and fun installation. It's going to be for us, it's going to be for friends, and potentially it's going to be for a wider audience as we are entering this project into the devart submission as well.

The "Playful geometries" project will be able scale from coffee-table personal living-room toy to hangar-size premiere-grand-opening scale, and it will be fully finished and operating in its small-scale version. Obviously there will be room for further improvement and we'll list areas where further work is needed/suggested, but the aim is have the project fully working as a fully fledged, albeit small scale, installation.

We'll detail further in coming posts the thinking and scope of the project.
