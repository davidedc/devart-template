The Franken-UI
-----------------------

At that funny stage where things start to be somewhat functional and they look like Frankenstein with some lipstick smudged all over the face.

Here you can see interaction with a slider, two radio buttons, one toggle button (which I don't think we are going to use anyways but it was on the way) and a simple button.
