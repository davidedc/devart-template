## Description
The primary aim is to have fun. Fun making something and fun playing with
the result. In terms of pushing boundaries we are setting out to make a
device from a $25 Raspberry Pi computer that can compete with a VJ's mac.
Hopefully using a large number of networked cheap computers will produce
something beyond the scope of a single expensive one.
